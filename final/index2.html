    <p><font color=black>The Animal Love Foundation has been a non-profit registered organization since 1991, assisting over 15,000 abandoned animals in finding new loving homes.

We are all volunteers, who work hard to help whatever animals we can.

We reach out to animals who are surrendered by their current families, homeless, abused and/or neglected in London and surrounding areas.

While in the care of Animal Love, the animals receive food, medical care, safety and a loving foster home until a "forever home" is found.

We do not have a shelter, so all of our cats and dogs are housed in wonderful foster homes until they are adopted. 

Animal Love does not receive city or government funding.  We rely on fundraising events and generous donations. If you would like to donate to our group

please click the donation button today and help save a furry friend in need.
